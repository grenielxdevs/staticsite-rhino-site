                    <h4>Rhino</h4>
                    <p>A <b>rhinoceros</b>, commonly abbreviated to <i>rhino</i>, is a member of any of the five extant
                        species of
                        odd-toed ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae, as well as any of the numerous extinct species
                        therein. Two of the extant species are native to Africa, and three to Southern Asia.
                    </p>
                    <P>Rhinos were once found throughout Eurasia and Africa, but today, three of the five rhino species
                        are Critically Endangered, meaning they face a high chance of extinction.
                    <p>
                        In recent years rhino numbers have dropped dramatically due to poaching for their horn which is
                        prized in Asian countries. They also face threats from habitat loss and political conflict.

                                Large-scale poaching saw black rhino populations decline from around 70,000 individuals

                                to the persistent efforts of conservation programmes across Africa, black rhino numbers
                                have risen since then to a current population of between 5,366 and 5,627 individuals.
                                Importantly, their geographic range has also increased, with successful reintroduction
                                programmes repopulating areas that had previously seen native black rhinos.

                                Greater one-horned rhinos have made a startling comeback from the brink of extinction.
                                By
                                1900, fewer than 200 individuals remained, but there are now more than 3,580
                                individuals,
                                due to concerted conservation efforts in both India and Nepal; their remaining
                                strongholds.
                                Although poaching remains a high threat, particularly in Kaziranga National Park, a key
                                area
                                for the species, the need to expand their habitat to provide space for the growing
                                population is a key priority.

                                The overwhelming rhino conservation success story is that of the Southern white rhino.
                                The
                                white rhino recovered from near extinction with numbers as low as 50 ‚Äì 100 left in the

                                in the early 1900‚Äôs, this sub-species of rhino has now increased to between 17,212 and
                                18,915, with the vast majority living in a single country, South Africa. The Northern

                                rhino, however, has only two females left, after the last male, Sudan, died in March
                                2018.

                                <p>Poaching and illegal trade of rhino horn has increased sharply since 2007 and remains
                                    one of the major reasons rhino are still endangered today. Poaching is big business,
                                    and well organised criminal gangs are now well-equipped to track and kill rhino. One
                                    rhino horn can fetch in excess of an incredible ¬£200,000.</p>

                                <p>Habitat loss is the other major threat to rhino populations. As more and more
                                    land is cleared for agriculture there is less available space for rhino to
                                    thrive in. Rhino need a large area in which to feed and roam. If rhino
                                    populations end up fragmented, with no safe ‚Äòcorridors‚Äô to travel through,
                                    chances of successful breeding and recovery will further decline.</p>

                        For decades, rhinos have been hunted by crime syndicates for their horns, which are then sold on
                        the black market. Today, they are one of the most endangered species on the planet ‚Äì that‚Äôs why
                        we protect them. Hemmersbach Rhino Force fights poachers with night vision, stealth boats,
                        drones, and if necessary also uses armed force. Patrolling the bush, our rangers risk their
                        lives every day to ensure the rhinos‚Äô and other wildlife‚Äôs survival.

                        the largest genetic reservoir for African rhinoceros in the world. The frozen reproductive
